    "The main goal, in general, is to score as many points as possible. However, a distinction can be made to which values the achieved score should ultimately be compared with. Examples of comparison values would be the maximum achievable score, and the score needed to become number 1 in the SPITCH ranking respectively to reach the profit zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal, to score as many points as possible, can be divided into two sub-problems. First, the players who are expected to score the most points should be included in the line-up. So the first problem is to find out, or predict as accurately as possible, how many points each player will score. Since only a limited budget is available, attention must be paid to their salaries. Therefore, the second problem is to put the cost of the players in mathematical relation to the points predicted in the first step. These types of optimisation problems are known in combinatorics as knapsack problems: from a set of objects, each having a weight and a utility, a subset has to be selected whose total weight does not exceed a given weight bound and maximises the utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for two main reasons, this is not a classic knapsack problem. Firstly, the budget set by the game can be exceeded, which means that the backpack can carry more weight than the weight bound specifies. However, the manager then starts the matchday with negative points. Vice versa; if the manager does not spend his entire budget, he starts with positive points. These points are called manager points. \n",
    "The second main reason is that this number of positive or negative points can be accurately calculated because there is a linear relationship between manager points and the cost of a player: every â‚¬100,000 is worth 0.8 manager points. For this reason, the costs of a player can be subtracted from the points scored, or a threshold of points can be calculated that a player must score to recoup his costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This calculation simplifies the main problem enormously, as now only these calculated values have to be used to set up the most optimal line-up.\n",
    "The main goal of achieving the maximum score can thus be transformed into the underlying problem: predicting the performance of each individual player as accurately as possible.   "
