# Optimizing Teams for Fantasy Football Games Using Machine Learning

This repository is part of Jakob Heine's master's thesis, which was written in the summer semester of 2021. The submitted version is on version branch v.1.0.0.

The repository is divided into two subdirectories: the [master-thesis](master_thesis/README.md) in which the LaTeX code for the master's thesis was versioned, and the [code](src/README.md) directory, which contains the source code of the application and the created Jupyter notebook. Each of these directories has its own README.
