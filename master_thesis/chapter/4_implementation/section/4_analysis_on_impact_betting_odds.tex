\section{Betting Odds Impact}

The results of the previous section suggest that betting odds have a positive influence on the predictive accuracy of the models. In this section, a two-sided t-test will be used to check whether this assumption is correct. The hypothesis is: "The accuracies of a model that predicts individual player performance increase under the influence of betting odds'. Therefore, the null hypothesis is: 'The accuracy of a model that predicts individual player performance does not increase under the influence of betting odds".
