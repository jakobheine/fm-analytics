\clearpage \section{Data}

The cornerstone of any machine learning project is the underlying data. In the following chapter, the three essential steps in dealing with data that took place during the thesis are highlighted. First, the data was obtained from various sources. Then the data was processed so that it could be brought into relation with each other. Finally, the data was analysed to gain insight into the characteristics of the data and to draw implications for the machine learning models.
