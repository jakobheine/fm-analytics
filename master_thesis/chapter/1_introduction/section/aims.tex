\clearpage \section{Aim and Delimitation}

This thesis aims to use the available data of a Fantasy Soccer League provider to create a machine learning model that predicts the individual performance of each soccer player for future matches as accurately as possible. Afterwards, based on this model, a team can be assembled and compared with other line-ups created by real-life opponents. For this purpose, different models will be examined that have proven successful in the existing literature. Therefore, a literature review will be conducted to overview the current state of research on these topics. Subsequently, the models will be complemented by betting odds to investigate whether betting odds provide a type of swarm intelligence and thus make the models more accurate. Finally, two questions are answered. Firstly: Is it possible to predict the future performance of players with the help of machine learning models? Furthermore secondly, does the influence of betting odds have a positive effect on these predictions?

However, the aim of this work goes beyond the mere investigation of different machine learning models. In addition, the predictions generated by the models are made available to users via an application implemented specifically for this purpose.  

Every problem requires a different approach to the solution, and this is particularly true in the machine learning sphere. Although this thesis seeks to the best of one's knowledge to address the above questions, the solutions are not generally transferable. Each model, feature or statistic has been adapted to the exact use case at hand, although always attempting to remain as generalist as possible for similar problems. Furthermore, the result often only shows the steps that led to success. In the course of this research, many steps were taken, which did not lead to the desired results and, for this reason of comprehension, are not mentioned. In addition, reasonable simplifications had to be made when the reality was too complex to implement. These passages are explicitly mentioned in the text.
