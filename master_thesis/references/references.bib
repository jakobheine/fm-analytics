	abstract = {There is growing interest in applying machine learning techniques in the research of materials science. However, although it is recognized that materials datasets are typically smaller and sometimes more diverse compared to other fields, the influence of availability of materials data on training machine learning models has not yet been studied, which prevents the possibility to establish accurate predictive rules using small materials datasets. Here we analyzed the fundamental interplay between the availability of materials data and the predictive capability of machine learning models. Instead of affecting the model precision directly, the effect of data size is mediated by the degree of freedom (DoF) of model, resulting in the phenomenon of association between precision and DoF. The appearance of precision–DoF association signals the issue of underfitting and is characterized by large bias of prediction, which consequently restricts the accurate prediction in unknown domains. We proposed to incorporate the crude estimation of property in the feature space to establish ML models using small sized materials data, which increases the accuracy of prediction without the cost of higher DoF. In three case studies of predicting the band gap of binary semiconductors, lattice thermal conductivity, and elastic properties of zeolites, the integration of crude estimation effectively boosted the predictive capability of machine learning models to state-of-art levels, demonstrating the generality of the proposed strategy to construct accurate machine learning models using small materials dataset.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider fantasy football, an increasingly-popular online game based on the actual, on-the-field performances of players in the National Football League. It is estimated by the Fantasy Sports Trade Association that in 2011 there were 35 million people in the US and Canada playing fantasy sports online. About 85 percent of all fantasy sports participants play fantasy football, most of whom have their games set up in major media websites such as Yahoo!, ESPN, MSN, and NFL. Numerous websites specialize in reporting NFL games, providing preseason rankings, fantasy points projections, team and player statistics, and expert draft opinions. However, despite the vast popularity of the game, the intensive analysis by experts, and various online tools that offer prediction for the values of players, to the best of our knowledge, there is no method that provides a comprehensive optimization strategy for the entire Fantasy Football season. We set out to develop such a methodology that predicts team and player performance based on the rich historical data, and builds a mixed-integer optimization model using such predictions for the draft selection as well as weekly line-up management that incorporates the entire objective of winning a fantasy football season. Numerical tests of our model show promising performance.},

Users have many tools at their disposal: statistics, predictions, rankings of experts and even recommendations of peers. There are issues with all of these, though. Especially since many people pay money to play, the prediction tools should be enhanced as they provide unbiased and easy-to-use assistance for users. This paper provides and discusses approaches to predict Fantasy Football scores of Quarterbacks with relatively limited data. In addition to that, it includes several suggestions on how the data could be enhanced to achieve better results. The dataset consists only of game data from the last six NFL seasons. I used two different methods to predict the Fantasy Football scores of NFL players: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Neural Networks. The results of both are promising given the limited data that was used.},

Second, we introduce a novel multinomial logistic regression approach for estimating the expected points for each play. Third, we use the expected points as input into a generalized additive model for estimating the win probability for each play. Fourth, we introduce our nflWAR framework, using multilevel models to isolate the contributions of individual offensive skill players in terms of their wins above replacement (WAR). We assess the uncertainty in WAR through a resampling approach specifically designed for football, and we present results for the 2017 NFL season. We discuss how our reproducible WAR framework can be extended to estimate WAR for players at any position if researchers have data specifying the players on the field during each play. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this work for NFL teams.},

	abstract = {A fantasy sport competition is an online competition in which participants act as the coach and selector of their own fantasy team of real players. These competitions are remarkably popular with currently over 5.5 million teams in the major competition of the English Premier League. A fantasy team scores points based on the statistical performances of the team’s players in their real-world sporting matches. The objective for each coach is to finish the season with the highest total number of points. During the season, coaches must manage a budget as well as trade players in and out of the team subject to a number of constraints. Due to their well-defined nature, as well as the simple objective function, these competitions lend themselves very naturally to analysis by Mixed Integer Programming (MIP). In this paper, we consider three different problems for the 2018 season of the AFL SuperCoach competition, modelling and solving each with MIP. The aim of each problem is to highlight the gap between what was achieved by real players and what was theoretically possible. The first problem is to determine all the decisions that a coach should have made to obtain the highest score possible. The second problem is to determine the lowest starting budget from which it would have been possible to win the competition. The third problem is to determine whether it would have been possible for a team that was set up at the start of the competition and completely forgotten about to win the competition.},

We use the player ratings provided by a popular Italian fantasy soccer game as proxies for the players’ performance; we discuss the merits and flaws of a variety of hierarchical Bayesian models for predicting these ratings, comparing the models on their predictive accuracy on hold-out data. Our central goals are to explore what can be accomplished with a simple freely available dataset comprising only a few variables from the 2015–2016 season in the top Italian league, Serie A, and to focus on a small number of interesting modeling and prediction questions that arise. Among these, we highlight the importance of modeling the missing observations and we propose two models designed for this task. We validate our models through graphical posterior predictive checks and we provide out-of-sample predictions for the second half of the season, using the first half as a training set. We use Stan to sample from the posterior distributions via Markov chain Monte Carlo.},

	abstract = {Betting odds are generally considered to represent accurate reflections of the underlying probabilities for the outcomes of sporting events. There are, however, known to be a number of inherent biases such as the favorite-longshot bias in which outsiders are generally priced with poorer value odds than favorites. Using data from European soccer matches, this paper demonstrates the existence of another bias in which the match odds overreact to favorable and unfavorable runs of results. A statistic is defined, called the Combined Odds Distribution (COD) statistic, which measures the performance of a team relative to expectations given their odds over previous matches. Teams that overperform expectations tend to have a high COD statistic and those that underperform tend to have a low COD statistic. Using data from twenty different leagues over twelve seasons, it is shown that teams with a low COD statistic tend to be assigned more generous odds by bookmakers. This can be exploited and a sustained and robust profit can be made. It is suggested that the bias in the odds can be explained in the context of the “hot hand fallacy”, in which gamblers overestimate variation in the ability of each team over time.},

We present the results of an empirical study that uses data from 678–837 games of three seasons of the German premier soccer league. Prediction markets and betting odds perform equally well in terms of forecasting accuracy, but both methods strongly outperform tipsters. A weighting-based combination of the forecasts of these methods leads to a slightly higher forecast accuracy, whereas a rule-based combination improves forecast accuracy substantially. However, none of the forecasts leads to systematic monetary gains in betting markets because of the high fees (25\%) charged by the state-owned bookmaker in Germany. Lower fees (e.g., approximately 12\% or 0\%) would provide systematic proﬁts if punters exploited the information from prediction markets and bet only on a selected number of games.

To implement the proposed model, the accumulated statistical data is processed into numerical value in order to implement those in the algorithms. Furthermore, aforementioned feature selection algorithms are applied for extracting the attributes that are more related to the output feature. Additionally, the machine learning algorithms are used to predict runs scored by a batsman and runs considered by a bowler in the upcoming match. The experimental setup demonstrates that the model gives up to 91.5\% accuracy for batsman Tamim and up to 75.3\% accuracy for bowler Mahmudullah whereas prediction accuracy for other players are also up to the mark. Therefore, this will help in calculating player’s future performance and thus will ensure better team selection for forthcoming cricket matches.},

Analyses of team tactics require however detailed data from various sources including technical skill, individual physiological performance, and team formations among others to represent the complex processes underlying team tactical behavior. Accordingly, little is known about how these different factors influence team tactical behavior in elite soccer. In parts, this has also been due to the lack of available data. Increasingly however, detailed game logs obtained through next-generation tracking technologies in addition to physiological training data collected through novel miniature sensor technologies have become available for research. This leads however to the opposite problem where the shear amount of data becomes an obstacle in itself as methodological guidelines as well as theoretical modelling of tactical decision making in team sports is lacking. The present paper discusses how big data and modern machine learning technologies may help to address these issues and aid in developing a theoretical model for tactical decision making in team sports. As experience from medical applications show, significant organizational obstacles regarding data governance and access to technologies must be overcome first. The present work discusses these issues with respect to tactical analyses in elite soccer and propose a technological stack which aims to introduce big data technologies into elite soccer research. The proposed approach could also serve as a guideline for other sports science domains as increasing data size is becoming a wide-spread phenomenon.},

In this article, we design and implement PlayeRank, a data-driven framework that offers a principled multi-dimensional and role-aware evaluation of the performance of soccer players. We build our framework by deploying a massive dataset of soccer-logs and consisting of millions of match events pertaining to four seasons of 18 prominent soccer competitions. By comparing PlayeRank to known algorithms for performance evaluation in soccer, and by exploiting a dataset of players’ evaluations made by professional soccer scouts, we show that PlayeRank significantly outperforms the competitors. We also explore the ratings produced by PlayeRank and discover interesting patterns about the nature of excellent performances and what distinguishes the top players from the others. At the end, we explore some applications of PlayeRank—i.e. searching players and player versatility—showing its flexibility and efficiency, which makes it worth to be used in the design of a scalable platform for soccer analytics.},

The presentation reveals a successful strategy for solving the ﬁrst problem that constructs 100 teams per week and wins 68\% of the time for a test set of 11 weeks of the weekly FanDuel Sunday Million contest for the 2016 season of the NFL. In addition, the approach achieves the highest scoring teams in a competition against 300,000 randomly selected teams for 5 of the 11 weeks. Regarding the second problem, we select winning teams 58\% of the time, the highest percentage against 50 participants in a CBS Sports pick’em league over the 2014, 2015, and 2016 seasons of the NFL. Here, our techniques win ﬁrst prize in each season and also accomplish the highest accuracy in 7 individual weeks over the 3 seasons, better than any other participant.},

The real performances of these players (or their teams) are translated into points for their team managers. The managers’ aim is to collect as many points as possible thereby defeating the fantasy teams of opponents. First, we discuss a number of common game rule characteristics of fantasy sport games. Based on these characteristics, we present a mixed integer programming model to produce and analyze ex-post results for a large variety of fantasy sport games. We discuss how these results create value for both the game organizer and the participants. Finally, we apply our system in practice to a fantasy cycling game.},

This article addresses the same challenge using as a test case a fantasy sport game organized by an Argentinian newspaper. Two mathematical programming models are presented that act as virtual coaches that choose a virtual team lineup for each round of the real Argentinian soccer league. The a priori design creates a competitive team for the game, while the a posteriori model determines what would have been its optimal lineup once the season is over and all the results are known. The a priori model was entered in the fantasy game, achieving results that positioned it among the highest scoring participants. Further development of such models would provide useful tools for supporting decision making by coaches or managers of real sports.},

Foreword CRISP-DM was conceived in late 1996 by three \&quot; veterans \&quot; of the young and immature data mining market. DaimlerChrysler (then Daimler-Benz) was already experienced, ahead of most industrial and commercial organizations, in applying data mining in its business operations. SPSS (then ISL) had been providing services based on data mining since 1990 and had launched the first commercial data mining workbench – Clementine – in 1994. NCR, as part of its aim to deliver added value to its Teradata data warehouse customers, had established teams of data mining consultants and technology specialists to service its clients\&\#39; requirements. At that time, early market interest in data mining was showing signs of exploding into widespread uptake. This was both exciting and terrifying. All of us had developed our approaches to data mining as we went along. Were we doing it right? Was every new adopter of data mining going to have to learn, as we had initially, by trial and error? And from a supplier\&\#39;s perspective, how could we demonstrate to prospective customers that data mining was sufficiently mature to be adopted as a key part of their business processes? A standard process model, we reasoned, non-proprietary and freely available, would address these issues for us and for all practitioners. A year later we had formed a consortium, invented an acronym (CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), obtained funding from the European Commission and begun to set out our initial ideas. As CRISP-DM was intended to be industry-, tool-and application-neutral, we knew we had to get input from as wide a range as possible of practitioners and others (such as data warehouse vendors and management consultancies) with a vested interest in data mining. We did this by creating the CRISP-DM Special Interest Group (\&quot; The SIG \&quot; , as it became known). We launched the SIG by broadcasting an invitation to interested parties to join us in Amsterdam for a day-long …},

	abstract = {Science is a cumulative endeavour as new knowledge is often created in the process of interpreting and combining existing knowledge. This is why literature reviews have long played a decisive role in scholarship. The quality of literature reviews is particularly determined by the literature search process. As Sir Isaac Newton eminently put it: “If I can see further, it is because I am standing on the shoulders of giants.” Drawing on this metaphor, the goal of writing a literature review is to reconstruct the giant of accumulated knowledge in a specific domain. And in doing so, a literature search represents the fundamental first step that makes up the giant’s skeleton and largely determines its reconstruction in the subsequent literature analysis. In this paper, we argue that the process of searching the literature must be comprehensibly described. Only then can readers assess the exhaustiveness of the review and other scholars in the field can more confidently (re)use the results in their own research. We set out to explore the methodological rigour of literature review articles published in ten major information systems (IS) journals and show that many of these reviews do not thoroughly document the process of literature search. The results drawn from our analysis lead us to call for more rigour in documenting the literature search process and to present guidelines for crafting a literature review and search in the IS domain.},

	abstract = {Information on the size of academic search engines and bibliographic databases (ASEBDs) is often outdated or entirely unavailable. Hence, it is difficult to assess the scope of specific databases, such as Google Scholar. While scientometric studies have estimated ASEBD sizes before, the methods employed were able to compare only a few databases. Consequently, there is no up-to-date comparative information on the sizes of popular ASEBDs. This study aims to fill this blind spot by providing a comparative picture of 12 of the most commonly used ASEBDs. In doing so, we build on and refine previous scientometric research by counting query hit data as an indicator of the number of accessible records. Iterative query optimization makes it possible to identify a maximum number of hits for most ASEBDs. The results were validated in terms of their capacity to assess database size by comparing them with official information on database sizes or previous scientometric studies. The queries used here are replicable, so size information can be updated quickly. The findings provide first-time size estimates of ProQuest and EbscoHost and indicate that Google Scholar’s size might have been underestimated so far by more than 50\%. By our estimation Google Scholar, with 389 million records, is currently the most comprehensive academic search engine.},
