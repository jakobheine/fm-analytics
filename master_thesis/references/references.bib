	abstract = {In this paper, we consider fantasy football, an increasingly-popular online game based on the actual, on-the-field performances of players in the National Football League. It is estimated by the Fantasy Sports Trade Association that in 2011 there were 35 million people in the US and Canada playing fantasy sports online. About 85 percent of all fantasy sports participants play fantasy football, most of whom have their games set up in major media websites such as Yahoo!, ESPN, MSN, and NFL. Numerous websites specialize in reporting NFL games, providing preseason rankings, fantasy points projections, team and player statistics, and expert draft opinions. However, despite the vast popularity of the game, the intensive analysis by experts, and various online tools that offer prediction for the values of players, to the best of our knowledge, there is no method that provides a comprehensive optimization strategy for the entire Fantasy Football season. We set out to develop such a methodology that predicts team and player performance based on the rich historical data, and builds a mixed-integer optimization model using such predictions for the draft selection as well as weekly line-up management that incorporates the entire objective of winning a fantasy football season. Numerical tests of our model show promising performance.},

We model the problem as a Bayesian reinforcement learning one, where the action space is exponential in the number of players and where the decision maker’s beliefs are over multiple characteristics of each footballer. We then exploit domain knowledge to construct computationally tractable solution techniques in order to build a competitive automated Fantasy Football manager. Thus, we are able to establish the baseline performance in this domain, even without complete information on footballers’ performances (accessible to human managers), showing that our agent is able to rank at around the top percentile when pitched against 2.5M human players.},

	abstract = {The ubiquity of professional sports and specifically the NFL have lead to an increase in popularity for Fantasy Football. Users have many tools at their disposal: statistics, predictions, rankings of experts and even recommendations of peers. There are issues with all of these, though. Especially since many people pay money to play, the prediction tools should be enhanced as they provide unbiased and easy-to-use assistance for users. This paper provides and discusses approaches to predict Fantasy Football scores of Quarterbacks with relatively limited data. In addition to that, it includes several suggestions on how the data could be enhanced to achieve better results. The dataset consists only of game data from the last six NFL seasons. I used two different methods to predict the Fantasy Football scores of NFL players: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Neural Networks. The results of both are promising given the limited data that was used.},

First, we develop the R package nflscrapR to provide easy access to publicly available play-by-play data from the National Football League (NFL). Second, we introduce a novel multinomial logistic regression approach for estimating the expected points for each play. Third, we use the expected points as input into a generalized additive model for estimating the win probability for each play. Fourth, we introduce our nflWAR framework, using multilevel models to isolate the contributions of individual offensive skill players in terms of their wins above replacement (WAR). We assess the uncertainty in WAR through a resampling approach specifically designed for football, and we present results for the 2017 NFL season. We discuss how our reproducible WAR framework can be extended to estimate WAR for players at any position if researchers have data specifying the players on the field during each play. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this work for NFL teams.},

And only once this measurement is defined, does modeling for predictive purposes make sense. We use the player ratings provided by a popular Italian fantasy soccer game as proxies for the players’ performance; we discuss the merits and flaws of a variety of hierarchical Bayesian models for predicting these ratings, comparing the models on their predictive accuracy on hold-out data. Our central goals are to explore what can be accomplished with a simple freely available dataset comprising only a few variables from the 2015–2016 season in the top Italian league, Serie A, and to focus on a small number of interesting modeling and prediction questions that arise. Among these, we highlight the importance of modeling the missing observations and we propose two models designed for this task. We validate our models through graphical posterior predictive checks and we provide out-of-sample predictions for the second half of the season, using the first half as a training set. We use Stan to sample from the posterior distributions via Markov chain Monte Carlo.},

	abstract = {Betting odds are generally considered to represent accurate reflections of the underlying probabilities for the outcomes of sporting events. There are, however, known to be a number of inherent biases such as the favorite-longshot bias in which outsiders are generally priced with poorer value odds than favorites. Using data from European soccer matches, this paper demonstrates the existence of another bias in which the match odds overreact to favorable and unfavorable runs of results. A statistic is defined, called the Combined Odds Distribution (COD) statistic, which measures the performance of a team relative to expectations given their odds over previous matches. Teams that overperform expectations tend to have a high COD statistic and those that underperform tend to have a low COD statistic. Using data from twenty different leagues over twelve seasons, it is shown that teams with a low COD statistic tend to be assigned more generous odds by bookmakers. This can be exploited and a sustained and robust profit can be made. It is suggested that the bias in the odds can be explained in the context of the “hot hand fallacy”, in which gamblers overestimate variation in the ability of each team over time.},

We present the results of an empirical study that uses data from 678–837 games of three seasons of the German premier soccer league. Prediction markets and betting odds perform equally well in terms of forecasting accuracy, but both methods strongly outperform tipsters. A weighting-based combination of the forecasts of these methods leads to a slightly higher forecast accuracy, whereas a rule-based combination improves forecast accuracy substantially. However, none of the forecasts leads to systematic monetary gains in betting markets because of the high fees (25\%) charged by the state-owned bookmaker in Germany. Lower fees (e.g., approximately 12\% or 0\%) would provide systematic proﬁts if punters exploited the information from prediction markets and bet only on a selected number of games.

The proposed model consists of statistical data of players of Bangladesh national cricket team which has been collected from trusted sports websites, feature selection algorithms such as recursive feature elimination and univariate selection and machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, support vector machine with linear and polynomial kernel. To implement the proposed model, the accumulated statistical data is processed into numerical value in order to implement those in the algorithms. Furthermore, aforementioned feature selection algorithms are applied for extracting the attributes that are more related to the output feature. Additionally, the machine learning algorithms are used to predict runs scored by a batsman and runs considered by a bowler in the upcoming match. The experimental setup demonstrates that the model gives up to 91.5\% accuracy for batsman Tamim and up to 75.3\% accuracy for bowler Mahmudullah whereas prediction accuracy for other players are also up to the mark. Therefore, this will help in calculating player’s future performance and thus will ensure better team selection for forthcoming cricket matches.},

	abstract = {Until recently tactical analysis in elite soccer were based on observational data using variables which discard most contextual information. Analyses of team tactics require however detailed data from various sources including technical skill, individual physiological performance, and team formations among others to represent the complex processes underlying team tactical behavior. Accordingly, little is known about how these different factors influence team tactical behavior in elite soccer. In parts, this has also been due to the lack of available data. Increasingly however, detailed game logs obtained through next-generation tracking technologies in addition to physiological training data collected through novel miniature sensor technologies have become available for research. This leads however to the opposite problem where the shear amount of data becomes an obstacle in itself as methodological guidelines as well as theoretical modelling of tactical decision making in team sports is lacking. The present paper discusses how big data and modern machine learning technologies may help to address these issues and aid in developing a theoretical model for tactical decision making in team sports. As experience from medical applications show, significant organizational obstacles regarding data governance and access to technologies must be overcome first. The present work discusses these issues with respect to tactical analyses in elite soccer and propose a technological stack which aims to introduce big data technologies into elite soccer research. The proposed approach could also serve as a guideline for other sports science domains as increasing data size is becoming a wide-spread phenomenon.},

In this article, we design and implement PlayeRank, a data-driven framework that offers a principled multi-dimensional and role-aware evaluation of the performance of soccer players. We build our framework by deploying a massive dataset of soccer-logs and consisting of millions of match events pertaining to four seasons of 18 prominent soccer competitions. By comparing PlayeRank to known algorithms for performance evaluation in soccer, and by exploiting a dataset of players’ evaluations made by professional soccer scouts, we show that PlayeRank significantly outperforms the competitors. We also explore the ratings produced by PlayeRank and discover interesting patterns about the nature of excellent performances and what distinguishes the top players from the others. At the end, we explore some applications of PlayeRank—i.e. searching players and player versatility—showing its flexibility and efficiency, which makes it worth to be used in the design of a scalable platform for soccer analytics.},

The managers’ aim is to collect as many points as possible thereby defeating the fantasy teams of opponents. First, we discuss a number of common game rule characteristics of fantasy sport games. Based on these characteristics, we present a mixed integer programming model to produce and analyze ex-post results for a large variety of fantasy sport games. We discuss how these results create value for both the game organizer and the participants. Finally, we apply our system in practice to a fantasy cycling game.},

	abstract = {General awareness of the potential of mathematics to support sports decision making has been raised by the movie “Moneyball” through its portrayal of a real professional American baseball club that used mathematical tools to improve team performance. This article addresses the same challenge using as a test case a fantasy sport game organized by an Argentinian newspaper. Two mathematical programming models are presented that act as virtual coaches that choose a virtual team lineup for each round of the real Argentinian soccer league. The a priori design creates a competitive team for the game, while the a posteriori model determines what would have been its optimal lineup once the season is over and all the results are known. The a priori model was entered in the fantasy game, achieving results that positioned it among the highest scoring participants. Further development of such models would provide useful tools for supporting decision making by coaches or managers of real sports.},
